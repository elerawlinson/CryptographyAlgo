<h1>Functions and Algorithms Related to Public Key Cryptography</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Project consists of implementations of several algorithms and functions which are relevant and/or important to the mathematics of modern public key encryption.</p>

<p>The first file, modpow, computes positive and negative modular powers; this function works for numbers at a cryptographic scale. This function is utilized in encryption schemas such as D-H key establishment.</p>

<p>The second file, bsgs, is an implementation of the Giant Step Baby Step algorithm, a means of solving the DLP in O(&#8730;n).</p>

<p>The last file finds a solution x to a list of congruences.</p>
